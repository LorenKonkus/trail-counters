# ThriftyCounter

ThriftyCounter is an AdafruitFeather M0 Adalogger based trail counter that records each trail user detection event as an entry in a .CSV file on a 
microSD card that can be collected and impportant into a spreadsheet. ThriftyCounter was developed as a followup to the UnoCounter project in an attempt to 
lower energy usage and improve battery life. An Arduino Uno requires a fair amount of power even when the microcontrolleris in sleep mode, and this
has an impact on the battery required for extended deployment times out in a forest. Batteries are expensive, and if we can halve or quarter the amount
of capacity that we need we can reduce the cost significantly. ThriftyCounter was a great step in that direction.

## Hardware Platform

ThriftyCounter is based on an Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger board, available at https://www.adafruit.com/product/2796 

In the same way that there's an ecosystem for Arduino Uno boards and shields that add additional capabilities, there's an ecosystem of Feather boards and "wings"
that stack and add capabilities. 

The adalogger board includes the processor, a LiPo battery charger, and a microSD card slot, so it has most of what we need (except a good real time clock - more on that
later). The ARM M0 processor on this board is different than the processor on the Uno board, but it is supported by the Arduino IDE development environment
so it was pretty straightforward to migrate the UnoCounter code to this platform. This processor has more memory and processing power available, and so there's
room to grow if we want to, say, enhance the software to collect data from multiple sensors.

The LiPo battery support on this board opens up a number of possibilities in power  management. If USB power is available, the adalogger board will 
automatically use that power source and charge an attached LiPo battery. If the USB power is lost, the adalogger board uses the LiPo battery as a source. 
This means you could use a cheap USB solar panel charger to power it during the day and keep the LiPo battery topped off, or periodically plug in an external USB
battery pack to top off an internal LiPo battery.

One thing the adalogger board doesn't have is a good real time clock, or RTC. The M0 processor provides an RTC and the software is able to use it as a backup
time source, but any information about the current date and time is lost 
whenever power is lost or the reset button is pressed. Fortunately, there are plug in feather wings that adds a battery backed up RTC. I've used one based on
the DS3231 chip, available at https://www.adafruit.com/product/3028 Plug this wing into the adalogger feather, and it keeps excellent track of date and times 
across battery changes, restarts, and so forth. 

## Software Platform

The ThriftyCounter software can be found in ThriftyCounter.ino in this repository.


## Sensor

See [Sensor Overview](SensorOverview.md) for more information on sensors.

I used RCWL-0516 microwave sensors when using this trail counter. These sensors can be powered directly from the board (using the GND and 3.3V pins 
and the output logic signal can be tied to one of the input pins (I used DIO 11 in the softwear). This sensor works best when located a couple inches 
away from the arduino boards and battery, with no metal or electronics directly in front or behind the antenna area on the sensor board.

The data sheets for the RCWL-0516 say that the board requires an input voltage between 4 and 28v, but that input is regulated to 3.3 volts to run board and the
samples that I've used seem totally happy running with the nice, clean, regulated 3.3v source that the adalogger feather can provide.
