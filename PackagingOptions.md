# Packaging Options

Here are several alternatives I've used for packaging a counter:

- ZipLoc Bag
- ABS Waterproof Box
- 3d Printed Enclosures

## ZipLoc Bag

The simpliest option when deploying a trail counter is to tuck it in a simple ZipLoc bag. These are waterproof, low cost, and easy to locate in small, odd areas. 
Bags are great for quickly deploying a prototype out on the trail.

On the downside, they aren't particularly robust, are vulnerable to animals, and may be mistaken as rubbish. Some sensors are very sensitive to their surroundings
and may be affected by batteries and controller locations, and that's hard to control in a bag. 

## ABS Waterproof Box

Commercial ABS waterproof junction boxes are solid and robust and available in many sizes and formats. Here's one that I've used.

This is relatively small at 6"x4"x3" but sill big enough for an Arduino Uno and is available at https://www.amazon.com/Zulkit-Waterproof-Electrical-Transparent-150x100x70/dp/B07RPNWD47

Being ABS, it's easy to use styrene solvent to glue plastic standoffs wherever needed to mount a circuit board.

If you have a transparent cover for the box, boards can be positioned so that LEDs are easily visible to confirm operation after positioning.

If you're using a microwave sensor that can sense presence through wood, one of my favorite placements is on a support beam under a bridge. Narrow bridges encourage
users to pass single file and at relatively slow speeds and help to ensure accurate counts.

## 3d Printed Enclosures

Still refining designs. Stay tuned.

## Tagging

Regardless of what package you use, it's good practice to include your name (or your organization's name) and a contact phone number in the package. If the 
package is misplaced, this information may help it find its way home. If it's located by a suspicious individual, a phone call can help the bomb squad determine that 
it's a LiPo battery and not C4.
